## Start

Open Torn and click the green **NWA** button on the right edge. Sign in with your **Limited Torn API key** the first time.

NWA prepares targets in the background. Click **NWA** to open a target within your stat limit that was recently confirmed available. You start the attack yourself. On first load, or when checks are old, NWA checks availability before opening a target and tries up to five matches.

The small **⚙** underneath opens settings, the target list, and suggestions. Your stat limit is saved between pages.

The backend is already set to [targetlist.grusmedia.no](https://targetlist.grusmedia.no). You only need your Torn key.

## Use

- **Targets:** browse the list or filter by estimated stats.
- **Check status:** check a target before opening its attack page.
- **Suggestions:** suggest a player or faction with a required comment.
- **Approvals:** faction leaders and co-leaders can approve or reject suggestions.

Your Limited key verifies your name and faction and reads your battle stats. We save it **encrypted in Supabase with an expiry of up to 7 days** so NWA can refresh target hospital and availability status in the background, including while you are offline. Checks run every **30 seconds**, within a limit per player. **Sign out and remove key** deletes your saved key. The script saves a session token; a backend restart requires signing in again, while saved keys can still support background checks until they expire.

Only allowed factions can use the list. Instant selection requires an availability check under 30 seconds old. A target can still enter hospital after a check. Battle stats are estimates; attacks are manual.

Disable any separate old **Torn Faction Target List** entry. Your installed version appears in the settings header.
